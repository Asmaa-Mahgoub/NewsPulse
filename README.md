NewsPulse ‚Äì Full-Stack News Aggregation & Articles Management Platform
Project Description
NewsPulse is a full-stack news platform built with Django REST Framework (backend) and React.js (frontend):
1.	News API Integration: Fetches and displays latest news from external APIs, supports keyword search, category filtering, and pagination.
2.	Articles Management: Allows authors/journalists to register, log in, manage their own articles (CRUD), view/edit their profiles, and securely change passwords. Admins have full control over all users and articles.
The system exposes RESTful API endpoints (Django) and integrates with a React-based frontend for a responsive and engaging user experience.________________________________________
